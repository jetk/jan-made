# This is the repo for Jan's Portfolio

It is served online, and is basically a static site with Vue primarily for routing and templating. But if you for some unknown reason want to clone and run your own version of it:

## Clone to local machine
```
git clone https://github.com/jetk/jan-made.git
```


## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
