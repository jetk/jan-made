# Metalize

## Why
Through absolutely no research, I concluded the internet really needed another stupid plugin that replaced browser text with something silly, a la cloud-to-butt. I also needed an excuse to practice writing Chrome plugins for a (slightly) more serious project.

## What
Metalize is a chrome plugin that lets you choose your metal browsing experience. It will then modify text on any webpage you load, adding umlauts and replacing letters to make the text 'Mörë Mëtäl' or 'Trve Kvlt'. It can occasionally be very funny to a specific type of person if they forget that it's on.

## How
I did no testing or prototyping and hacked this together with a lot of swearing and beer, at a time where I didn't know the chrome plugin SDK and barely knew javascript. It was delightfully unprofessional of me.

## Outcome
I published metalize and forgot about it, and at some point later the chrome web store must have taken it down for not being compliant with some security upgrade. It's still available [on my github](https://github.com/jetk/Metalize/), and I might just have to reimplement it one night.
