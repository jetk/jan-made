# Contactless

## Why
Contactless payments have long been enabled across Ticketer-powered buses, but the Tap-On as well as the Tap-On-Tap-Off model were always held back by the complexity of bus fares outside of London. As passengers demanded simpler and faster boarding, our customers asked us what we could do.

## What
TOTO is a feature available on all modern Ticketer equipment that lets operators configure simple fare structures and accept tap-and-go boarding. This in turn lets passengers travel without hassle by simply tapping their contactless payments card or mobile device.

## How
Working with a business analyst, hardware and software engineers, we mapped out complex changes to several connected systems that enabled Ticketer's on-bus payments terminal to be used as a tap reader and for these taps to be joined up on Ticketer servers to build a picture of passenger journeys, enabling accurate pricing and most importantly: daily and weekly caps. After running months of trials with a South England bus operator, we had iterated through all edge cases caused by complex routing and were ready to launch.

## Outcome
TOTO has become the most popular way pay for every bus operator that Ticketer has enabled it for. It has enabled the UK's first capped contactless travel scheme.
