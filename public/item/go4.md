# Go4Venture

## Why
Go4Venture was a investment syndication platform that helped smaller startups raise capital from less-well-known investment providers. As we were trying to create a new product category from scratch, I knew we would have to rigorously test all features before building them.

## What
The Go4Venture test platform was effectively an ultra-high-fidelity prototype available to a pilot group of users. All features were backed onto 'dumb' APIs, where requests were processed by humans until the feature was validated and the feature was implemented in earnest.

## How
Extensively interviewing customers and management, I built a front-end only webapp in AngularJS + Material Design. Running extensive user tests to validate that features were worth investing in, I then translated the design for implementation by an offshore development team.

## Outcome
Go4Venture was popular with a small group of users by the time that I left. Eventually the business was wound down when the founder determined that the returns did not justify the effort invested, despite the project of helping startups raise funding being close to our hearts.
