# European Space Agency Longitudinal Voice Analysis App - With [ESA](http://www.esa.int/) and [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/)

## Why
The European Space Agency was exploring ways to measure long-term stress of isolation for astronauts. One promising avenue was longitudinal voice analysis, analyzing samples of a person's voice over weeks and months to detect changes in psychological state. Before investing in an extended study on actual astronauts, the ESA needed to validate that longitudinal voice analysis was viable. 

## What
The Longva app invites users to record voice samples each day with unobtrusive prompts and a conversational UI. High-fidelity recordings are sent to a proprietary server for detailed audio analysis.

## How
Working with team of three, I developed the app's client-server architecture and wrote the app front-end. The app's UI was designed in collaboration with University College London's Psychology department who provided guidance on conversational UX and user frustration 

## Outcome
The app was used to successfully validate longitudinal voice analysis for further study by the ESA as part of the [VULCAN program](https://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/project/voice/) focused on providing psychological care to astronauts on 2-year long manned Mars missions.
