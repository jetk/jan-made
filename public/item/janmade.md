# Jan-Made.com - Shipped Solo

## Why
I wanted a portfolio site that reflected my ethos as a maker and a product manager. I wanted to start low-cost, be online ASAP, and have the flexibility to iterate and upgrade based on measurement. I also wanted to show what could be achieved by applying the pareto principle and choosing simple tools well.

## What
Jan-Made.com is VueJS responsive web app using Bootstrap and my own styles for layout. Jan-Made has and needs no CMS, as new items are added infrequently enough to add new projects as markdown files which are then rendered using vue-showdown. It is served from my github repo by Netlify for free. Analytics are powered by Netlify on the server side and require no front-end code.

## How
One afternoon, I had largely decided how not to build this portfolio. Website builders like Squarespace were appealing, but I knew that a) I wouldn't need half the features I was being charged for and b) the amount of time it would take me to customize a template to my liking could be as well spent building my own from scratch. I experimented and then ruled out CMS's like Prismic, again because of YAGNE. Other platforms like dribbble and portfoliobox were targeted at different use cases, so those were ruled out too. In the end I chose to use the technologies I build my web-apps with because they were more than powerful enough and gave me the speed I needed to get this portfolio in front of people. Instead of struggling with finding appropriate screenshots that fit with the Art Deco aesthetic I'd settled on, I decided to make my own graphics using the design tool I was fastest in: Powerpoint. And finally, to ensure I had uptime reliability that fit the scale of traffic I expected, as well as being able to work from any device, I chose to use Netlify which lets me update the site with a git push or even using the github web UI.
