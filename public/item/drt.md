# Demand Responsive Transport

## Why
The UK bus industry was suffering from shared taxi services, also finding itself with a lot of under-utilized routes and vehicles. At the same time, passengers struggled to take slower and infrequent buses that didn't stop where they needed to go. Because many buses had our on-board ticket machines, which are internet-connected touch-screen computers, we thought: what if we could turn a bus into a shared taxi?

## What
Ticketer D.R.T. is a prototype that allows buses to get to on-demand stops using sat-nav and pick up dynamically booked passengers with a digital manifest. It runs on any Ticketer on-board ticket machine.

## How
After validating the idea with management and customers, I worked with a team of engineers to build a prototype with as many off-the-shelf components as possible, accelerating our time-to-test by being strict with our priorities. As trials confirmed the viability of the product and features, we enhanced progressively.

## Outcome
D.R.T. is in continued trials with a number of bus operators that are providing valuable feedback.
