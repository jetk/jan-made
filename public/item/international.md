# Internationalization - with [Ticketer](https://www.ticketer.com/)

## Why
Our larger international customers wanted to use Ticketer's transport technology in their overseas operations. The challenge was not only to internationalize the product portfolio, but to fundamentally change the data model to account for multiple currencies. 

## What
The internationalization of Ticketer's product portfolio allows bus operators to accept multiple currencies on the same bus service. Language localization allows non-English-speaking drivers to operate the product.

## How
Working with the database team, I conducted an extensive audit of the Ticketer data model, mapping out all financial data flows and configuration points. Having migrated the database to allow a one-to-many relationship of bus tickets to currencies, I led the front-end team to rebuild the UI for multi-currency multi-language bus service operations.

## Outcome
Ticketer has begun its international expansion with 2 million passengers travelling between Dublin and Belfast able to pay in Euros and Pound Stirling
