# Safety Checklists

## Why
Before Ticketer released its product, the majority of the UK bus industry was performing its mandatory safety checks on each bus, every day, by hand. This meant that every driver was walking around with a checklist card, filling it out with pen, driving and dropping it off for a clerk to copy out. This meant thousands of hours per year wasted and potentially dangerous failures from untracked data.

## What
Ticketer Safety Checklists began as a simple digital checklist available to drivers via their on-board ticket-machines. After launching, measuring and engaging with customer feedback, it has evolved into a sophisticated fleet engineering management product. It allows bus drivers to report safety defects instantaneously, for engineering managers to track work, and for complete records to be retrieved on demand for regulators.  

## How
Travelling to meet with our customers and see how their employees were using our safety checklists, I established how this feature could evolve into a product in its own right. After refactoring the feature's information architecture, I then worked with device and SaaS developers to ship the enhanced version and iterated on further feedback.

## Outcome
The product was the most-requested of our portfolio in 2019, and is now enabled on thousands of buses UK-wide.
