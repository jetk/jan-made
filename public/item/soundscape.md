# Microsoft Soundscape

## Why
Microsoft soundscape exists to help visually impaired and sighted people navigate and discover urban environments without looking at a screen. Independent mobility is extremely difficult for the visually impaired who otherwise have to rely on step-counting and route memorization to get between a few very specific points, missing out on any discovery on the way.

## What
Microsoft soundscape is a navigation and discovery app with a specialized interface that can be operated without looking at the screen. Using spatial audio, the user can get to any point in the city with turn-by-turn navigation, walk down a street and have points of interest narrated, or follow a 3D audio beacon to nearby places

## How
I was part of a six-person team working on Cities Unlocked, an R&D project that was the precursor to Soundscape. I focused on interface design, UI learnability and discovery features. Prototyping in Unity, I build a reusable radial interface library, in-app tutorial and a discovery feature that described points of interest as a user walked around.

## Outcome
Several of the features prototyped during Cities Unlocked were eventually productionized into Microsoft Soundscape, which was [launched in 2018](https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/01/microsoft-soundscape-helps-the-visually-impaired-navigate-cities/) and has a 4.2 star rating on the [app store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-soundscape/id1240320677)
