# Kazoot

## Why
Speaking to our customers (5,000 bus companies) and their passengers, I confirmed that bus companies and their passengers were desperate for mobile tickets. Aside from a few big players nobody could afford to build their own apps, and no passenger wants to download a new app every place they go to just to ride the bus. We needed to provide a free platform for any bus company to sell its tickets, that passengers could download once and travel anywhere with.

## What
Kazoot lets you buy tickets from all of our bus operators (covering 80% of the regional UK). It also includes route and timetable information from them, letting you plan your journey. It shows you where your bus is on the map, so you don't waste your time standing around at the bus stop. Kazoot is built as native Android and IOS apps, powered by a .NET Core API.

## How
I led a team comprised of a UX designer, architect, business analyst, test automation engineer, 3 IOS and 3 Android developers. Together, we researched, prototyped, built, tested, shipped, measured and iterated an app that we designed to become the UK's default ticketing and navigation app.

## Outcome
The app has been successful in soft launch, becoming the default ticketing modality in the 5 places we ran trials with our customers. Then the Coronavirus Pandemic of 2020 halted most travel.
