     <h1>A portfolio of things that Jan Klug has made</h1>
     <p>Hi. I'm Jan Klug. I make things in three ways:</p>
     <ul>
         <li>As a product manager, leading teams to design, prototype, build, test and iterate</li>
         <li>As a hands-on developer, I make a lot of serverless Webapps (like this one) and PWAs these days</li>
         <li>As an advisor to startups, helping people define what they should make</li>
     </ul>
     <p>Each card on the home screen will tell you why I or my team made something, what was made, how it was made, and what the outcome of making it was.</p>
     <p>This website is jan-made as well, click <a href="./item/janmade">here</a> to learn more</p>
     <p>P.S. I know about the navigation bar issue, I'll fix it in prod ;)</p>
