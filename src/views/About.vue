     <h1>A portfolio of things that Jan Klug has made</h1>
     <p>Hi. I'm Jan Klug. I make things in three ways:</p>
     <ul>
         <li>As a product manager, leading teams to design, prototype, build, test and iterate</li>
         <li>As a hands-on developer, I work mainly in web technologies these days</li>
         <li>As a startup advisor, which is more helping people who make things</li>
     </ul>
     <p>Each card on the home screen will tell you why I or my team made something, what we made, how we made it, and what the outcome of making it was.</p>
